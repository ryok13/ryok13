# Hi there 👋

## My Profile
I'm Ryo Kato, a Computing programming student at Georgian College (Co-op Program). Previously, I worked for **4 years as a System Engineer** in Japan, focusing on **system operations, maintenance, and software development**. 
My experience includes:  
- Developing frontends and BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) using **TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS**
- Improving **UI clarity and usability** for advertising tools  
- Maintaining and monitoring **financial systems** (50–80 daily operations, 150+ client companies supported)  
- Mentoring junior engineers and collaborating in **Agile** teams  

💡 I bring a strong attention to detail, adaptability, and a proactive mindset, with proven skills in **HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python, Power BI, SQL, and React.js** etc.  

🚀 Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge, creating private projects, and preparing for **PL-300 (Power BI) certification** while seeking **Co-op/Internship opportunities** in software development and data analytics.
